# What is Xcratch

Xcratch is a mod application of [Scratch3 by MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to play with user-made extensions easily.

**online installation and auto-loading on demand**

You can install and use user-made extensions from the web. Once you make a project with extended blocks, the project can be opened on Xcratch without installing required extensions by user.

**Built-in Web Bluetooth API**

You don't need to run [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/microbit) to play with micro:bit or BLE devices when your browser is Chrome, Edge or 'Web Bluetooth API' supporting one (the browser in Chromebook, [‎Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055) in iPadOS, like that).

## Sample Extensions

### ✨ Microbit More 

Download the latest connection program from [Releases · yokobond/pxt-mbit-more-v2](https://github.com/yokobond/pxt-mbit-more-v2/releases) into your micro:bit then connect it from following Microbit More link.
